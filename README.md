# **Wi-Fi Test Suite - Unified CAPI Console (UCC)**

##Wi-Fi Test Suite Introduction
Wi-Fi Test Suite is a software platform originally developed by Wi-Fi Alliance, the global non-profit industry association that brings you Wi-Fi&reg;, to support certification program development and device certification. Non-proprietary components are provided under the ISC License and can be accessed at this open source project on GitHub. Wi-Fi Alliance members can access the full software package, including proprietary components, on the [Wi-Fi Alliance member site](https://www.wi-fi.org/members/certification-testing/sigma).

## UCC and how to get it
The Unified CAPI Console (UCC) provides the overall control console for the Wi-Fi Test Suite.

UCC runs tests defined by input text files containing CAPI commands[(CAPI specification)](http://www.wi-fi.org/file/wi-fi-test-suite-control-api-specification-v831) . The individual CAPI commands within the input files are handled by UCC to perform functions such as DUT configuration, traffic stream definition, and test execution. UCC will direct specific CAPI commands to the appropriate device. This is accomplished via the Control Network.

UCC can be downloaded through the [open source repository](https://github.com/Wi-FiTestSuite/Wi-FiTestSuite-UCC)  or by members in the most recent Wi-Fi Test Suite package.

## Dependencies
UCC requires [python version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) to be installed.
